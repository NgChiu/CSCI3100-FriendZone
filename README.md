# CSCI3100-FriendZone
### About Us
FriendZone is a website designed for people, mostly students, to expand their friend zones and social networks. In a society that people work or study all day and have no free time, it is hard to find suitable time to meet friends. Our objective is to provide a platform which users can easily find people to spend good times together and meet new friends. This platform serves the purpose of linking people with same interests together. Users can host different activities, for example sports, study groups or simply to have a meal. We hope that via our platform, people can build a community where people share the same interest.
